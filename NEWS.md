# News

_This package is in early development; minor versions may introduce breaking changes. New features are shown in this news file, but many internal improvements are not._

## v0.2.4

* Add blade factoring function, `factorblade()`.

## v0.2.3

* Rewrite symbolic engine (uses `GeometricAlgebra.MiniCAS` instead of `SymbolicUtils`).
* Add option to suppress small components when displaying multivectors.
* Add Faddeev-LeVerrier implementation of multivector inverses, `inv_flv_method()`.
* Fix bugs with `sqrt()` and `outermorphism()`.

## v0.2.2

* Add ability to customise the order in which basis blades are displayed with `BasisDisplayStyle` on a per-algebra basis. (E.g., so that `3v12 - 2v13 + 1v23` displays as `1ùíÜ23 + 2ùíÜ31 + 3ùíÜ12` or `1ùíä + 2ùíã + 3ùíå`).

* Add `@symbolicga` convenience macro for compiling symbolically evaluated expressions, inspired by [serenity4/SymbolicGA.jl](https://github.com/serenity4/SymbolicGA.jl).

## v0.2.1

* Support `Multivector`s with immutable component arrays (in particular, `SVector`s).
Various improvements to type stability throughout.

* Change `BasisBlade` constructor argument order to `BasisBlade{Sig}(coeff, bits)`. Matches the convention used throughout where the coefficient is followed by the unit basis blade, agreeing with mathematical notation.

* Prefer `0:dim:dim` over `(0, dim)` as the grade parameter of scalar-pseudoscalars. This is more consistent with `0:dim` and `0:2:dim`.

* Add `basis(Multivector{Sig,K})` to generate a multivector basis, and `basis(sig, k)` for a basis of blades (`k` is no longer a keyword argument for consistency).

## v0.2.0

* Remove `KVector{Sig,K}` and `Multivector{Sig}` types in favour of `Multivector{Sig,K}`, where the grade `K` may now be a collection (e.g., range, tuple) in order to represent inhomogeneous multivectors.
This simplifies and generalises the types: only one parametric type is needed, and arbitrary grade combinations (e.g., `0:2:dim` for even multivectors) may be represented efficiently.

* Grade promotion between different grades returns the next smallest subalgebra out of
   - `0` for scalars,
   - `(0, dim)` for scalar-pseudoscalars,
   - `0:2:dim` for even multivectors,
   - `0:dim` for general multivectors,

	for more efficient representations.

* Remove `vector_repr` and make `matrix_repr` allow subspace representations.

* Rename `poincaredual` to `rdual` and add `ldual`. These are also known as the right and left complements.

* Add sandwich product and ‚Äòantiwedge‚Äô product `‚à®`.

## v0.1.2

* Rename `Blade`, `Multivector` and `MixedMultivector` to `BasisBlade`, `KVector` and `Multivector`, respectively, to more closely reflect standard terminology.

	- `BasisBlade` is appropriate because only basis blades are representable, not all blades.
	- `KVector` aligns with ‚Äúk-vector‚Äù, common for homogeneous multivectors.
	- `Multivector` is a general term which includes inhomogeneous multivectors.

* Use `Symbolics.jl` to optimise geometric and derived products by performing computations algebraically and reusing the results.

* Naive implementations of `log`, `sqrt` and trig functions using matrix methods.

* Add duality operations `flipdual`, `hodgedual` and `poincaredual`. Have not defined `dual` because there doesn‚Äôt seem to be a single universal notion of multivector duality.

## v0.1.1

* Add inner and scalar products and left/right contraction products.

* Add `cayleytable` for printing multiplication tables, inspired by [ATell-SoundTheory/CliffordAlgebras.jl](https://github.com/ATell-SoundTheory/CliffordAlgebras.jl).

* Add `vector_repr` and `matrix_repr` for converting between geometric algebra and matrix algebra. (Only the canonical linear representation is supported.)

* Add `Cl(p, q, r)` metric signature, and allow integers for Euclidean spaces.

## v0.1.0

* Initial working version
